In every stitch, there's a story — and as a fashion designer and educator, I’ve learned that fashion is more than fabric. It’s identity, it’s culture, it’s empowerment.

Through teaching, I’ve seen creativity spark confidence in my students. I believe that the right cut, the right fit, and the right knowledge can transform not just wardrobes — but lives.

This blog is my space to share lessons from the runway and the classroom. Expect sketches, tips, fabric picks, and real-talk about the journey behind the glam.

Stay inspired.
